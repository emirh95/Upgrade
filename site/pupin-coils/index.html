            <h2>Pupin coils</h2>
            <p class="first-p"> Pupin's 1899 patent for loading coils, archaically called "Pupin coils", followed
                closely on the pioneering work of
                the
                English physicist and mathematician Oliver Heaviside, which predates Pupin's patent by some seven years.
                The
                importance
                of the patent was made clear when the American rights to it were acquired by American Telephone &
                Telegraph (AT&T),
                making him wealthy. Although AT&T bought Pupin's patent, they made little use of it, as they already had
                their own
                development in hand led by George Campbell and had up to this point been challenging Pupin with
                Campbell's own
                patent.</p>
                <p>AT&T were afraid they would lose control of an invention which was immensely valuable due to its ability
                to greatly
                extend the range of long distance telephones and especially submarine ones.</p>
